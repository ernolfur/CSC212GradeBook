# Research Project Structure                      (tenative plan, most likely will change)
- Data Structures: B-Tree, Skip List
- Algorithm: Naive Algorithm
## Objective
We are going to be creating a **gradebook management program**. 

Users will be able to store and manage data relating to information stored in a real gradebook.

This program will be designed to simulate fundamental features of a gradebook system. 

We hope to show in our program that we gained a more in-depth understanding of data structure implementation and system design.
## Data
- First and Last Name
- Lab and Assignment Grades (out of 100)
- Attendance
Format:
```
Student Name,Lab 1,Lab 2,Lab 3,Assignment 1,Assignment 2,Assignment 3,Attendance Count
Jane Doe,30,56,23,92,94,96,16
John Smith,30,56,23,92,94,96,16
Alice Johnson,30,56,23,92,94,96,16
```

## Features
- Sort grades lowest to highest
- Flexible Grading Scale: Calculate mean, median, mode
- Search student info(names,grades,etc)

# Tasks For Each D&A
## Naive Algorithm
- Calculate grade mean, median, and mode for whole class.
- Search student information by name, output whole line if found.
- Search student info by grade, output whole line if found.
# B tree
- Insert new entire student information
  
# Skip-List
- Delete entire line student information
