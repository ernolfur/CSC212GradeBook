# Getting Started
## Program Functionality
This program's functionality involves multiple commands involving data handling operations and search queries. User's should download the program's source files, import it into their desired development environment, and compile the program files. Users are then able to run the executible file, where they are greeted with numerous commands that will allow them to manipulate the data within the .csv file. This program should be used to gain an insight on how a gradebook functions and operates, by testing out the program's functionalities.
## Commands
Sort: outputs student name and average grade from lowest to highest
Delete: deletes student information by name search
Append: append new student information to .csv file
Search_name: flexible search command that allows to search users by their specific name or pattern search.
Search_grade: Search for a specific grade and output student information
Bonus: Output student names who meet attendance bonus.
Above: Outputs the percentage of students that have a grade average about the user input.

## Program Usage Instructions
The program usage involves interacting with the menu that the user will be greeted with when run the program. This menu will offer multiple commands that the user can access to test the program's functionalities. We want the user to use this program to gain insight on how a gradebook structure works and also see how we were able to implement the data structures/algorithms mentioned.

## Program Dependencies
Users will need all of the required files to run C++ including the compiler, STL library, build tools and systems, and a compatible OS system. More on this can be found in the installation instructions.

## Program Installation Instructions
1. You need to download the essential components to run C++ such as the build system, compiler, and STL library. This can be downloaded here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170
Note: installation varies on your OS system.

2. Download the source code on our github repo here: https://github.com/ernolfur/CSC212GradeBook/tree/main

3. To import, compile, and run the source code, we recommend development environments such as VSCode or Clion. Download link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  
4. Compile the program, and enjoy!
